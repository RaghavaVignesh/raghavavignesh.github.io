            <h2 class="rag1">My bubu,</h2>
            <p class="rag2">Every day I wake up with gratitude for having you in my life. Your laughter is the melody that brightens my day, and your smile, the canvas that paints my world with vibrant hues. Your presence fills every moment with joy, and your absence leaves me longing for that warmth only you can bring. You are the love I've dreamed of, and being with you feels like the most beautiful adventure.

                Your kindness, your warmth, your unwavering support they all create a tapestry of love that I cherish endlessly. You're the one I want to share every laugh, every tear, and every dream with. You're my confidante, my partner-in-crime, and my solace.
                
                As we navigate through life's ups and downs, I find strength in your love, knowing you're there by my side. You've become the compass that guides me through the uncertainties, and I'm grateful for your unwavering belief in us.
                
                By the way, I'm eagerly waiting for your love note or even just a simple 'Hi.' Your messages light up my world, and knowing you're thinking of me makes my day complete.
                
                Forever and always,
                Your dudu </p>
